This is my attempt to enable building ffmpeg on visual studio and other build environments eventually, I dont expect it to be used widely maybe i will be the only user.
I am continuing the work done already to build ffmpeg 0.6 on VS. The documentation is the same as what i inherited from the previous group and i am retaining the same
licence terms as of now, i would like to move to a BSD 3 clause licence eventually, by removing all the gpl and lgpl code.
